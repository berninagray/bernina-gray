Bernina Gray Personal Website Project

#### Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job putting together a really comprehensive persona and goals for your PWP! Everything worked together very well and I thought your persona was realistic and well thought-out. It matched with your goals and communicated what you are looking to create in your personal site. I especially like how you connected data design knowledge with working for a start up, as well as the different elements needed for remote work.

The formatting of your HTML could use some cleaning, but the content of it and the set up of your repo look great. I look forward to seeing your personal site showcase your ability to learn a lot very quickly!

Your Milestone 1 passes at a [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.
#### Edits & Suggestions
* Watch your indentation and the placement of tag elements in your HTML code - try to keep opening and closing tags (especially that have other tags inside them) on different lines, and in line with each other so they are on the same level of indentation.

For example:
```
<div>
  <h2>Bernina Gray</h2>
  <h3>Web Development Internship</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      <span>
        <a href="https://github.com/berninagray" title="Github Student Portfolio">Github Student Portfolio</a>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernina-gray-066-071/" title="LinkedIn Profile">LinkedIn Profile</a>
      </span>
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Purpose, Audience & Goals</h3>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
  <div>
    <p>To establish myself as an entry-level asset/intern to a local company that is willing to teach and mold me as an member of their team. Challenge me as a developer to acquire new skills for constant growth.</p>
  </div>
  ...
</div>
```

* Side note: the git@githitub.com URLs are used for doing git commands from the command line but don't do much outside of that. You can click on "Use HTTPS" from the "Clone or download" tab to see the normal web URL for linking to GitHub projects!
